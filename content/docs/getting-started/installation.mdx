# Install

There are several ways to install kftray. Pick the method that matches your platform and preference, then move on to the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start).

## Desktop Interface (kftray)

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Linux', 'Windows']}>
<Tab value="macOS">

Install via Homebrew (recommended):

```bash
brew tap hcavarsan/kftray
brew install --cask kftray
```

Or download `kftray_universal.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray/releases/latest). The universal binary works on both Intel and Apple Silicon.


</Tab>
<Tab value="Linux">

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap hcavarsan/kftray
brew install kftray-linux
```

Or download the AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray/releases/latest):

- `kftray_amd64.AppImage` — x86_64 systems
- `kftray_aarch64.AppImage` — ARM64 systems

Make it executable before running:

```bash
chmod +x kftray_amd64.AppImage
./kftray_amd64.AppImage
```

<Callout type="warn" title="GNOME Users">
The system tray icon requires AppIndicator support. Install the [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) for the tray icon to appear. KDE, XFCE, and i3 include tray support by default.
</Callout>

</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows">

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray/releases/latest):

- `kftray_x64-setup.exe` — standard x86_64 systems
- `kftray_arm64-setup.exe` — ARM64 devices (Surface Pro X, etc.)

The installer configures PATH and creates Start Menu entries automatically.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Terminal Interface (kftui)

<Tabs items={['Homebrew', 'Cargo', 'Installer Script', 'Windows']}>
<Tab value="Homebrew">

```bash
brew tap hcavarsan/kftray
brew install kftui
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Cargo">

```bash
cargo install kftui
```

Requires a working Rust toolchain. See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) if you don't have one.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Installer Script">

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcavarsan/kftray/main/hacks/kftui_installer.sh)
```

Or with `wget`:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcavarsan/kftray/main/hacks/kftui_installer.sh)
```

This installs `kftui` to `/usr/local/bin/` and requires `sudo` for the system-wide install.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows">

Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcavarsan/kftray/main/hacks/kftui_installer.ps1'))
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Manual Binary Downloads

If the installer scripts don't work in your environment (corporate firewalls, restricted networks), download binaries directly from the [latest release](https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray/releases/latest):

| Platform | Desktop | Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| macOS (Universal) | `kftray_universal.dmg` | `kftui_macos_universal` |
| Linux x86_64 | `kftray_amd64.AppImage` | `kftui_amd64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `kftray_aarch64.AppImage` | `kftui_arm64` |
| Windows x64 | `kftray_x64-setup.exe` | `kftui_x86_64.exe` |
| Windows ARM64 | `kftray_arm64-setup.exe` | — |

## Verifying the Installation

<Tabs items={['Desktop', 'Terminal']}>
<Tab value="Desktop">

Launch kftray from your applications menu. You should see a system tray icon (a small Kubernetes logo). Click it to open the main configuration interface.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Terminal">

```bash
kftui
```

You should see a text-based interface with an empty configuration list and keyboard shortcuts at the bottom. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Storage

Both interfaces store data in `~/.kftray/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kftray.db` | SQLite database with all configurations and state |
| `app.log` | Application logs |
| `http_logs/` | HTTP traffic captures (when enabled) |

This directory is shared between both interfaces, so configurations created in one appear instantly in the other.
