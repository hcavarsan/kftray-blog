# Introduction

Putting it simply, kftray is a cross-platform tool for managing Kubernetes port forwards with automatic reconnection, UDP support, and team configuration sharing.

## Why We Built This

We kept running into the same friction with `kubectl port-forward` during daily Kubernetes development. The built-in command works fine for one-off TCP connections, but it falls short in a few common scenarios:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Dropped connections">
When pods restart, your forward dies and you have to manually reconnect.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No UDP support">
`kubectl port-forward` only handles TCP. Services like DNS or certain message queues are out of reach.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Terminal sprawl">
Managing multiple forwards means juggling multiple terminal windows or complex shell scripts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No team sharing">
Configuration sharing becomes a manual file-passing exercise.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

kftray solves these by wrapping Kubernetes port forwarding in a managed layer that handles reconnection, protocol bridging, and configuration persistence.

## Use Cases

<Cards>
<Card title="Local microservices development">
Forward your database, API gateway, and backend services to `localhost` with a single click or command.
</Card>
<Card title="Production debugging">
Temporarily forward specific services for investigation without setting up VPN tunnels.
</Card>
<Card title="Team onboarding">
Share port-forward configurations via JSON files or GitHub repositories so new developers get a working environment in minutes.
</Card>
<Card title="UDP services">
Access DNS, DHCP, or other UDP-based services that `kubectl port-forward` can't reach.
</Card>

## Two Interfaces, One Configuration

kftray comes in two flavors that share the same configuration database:

| | Desktop (`kftray`) | Terminal (`kftui`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Visual management, system tray convenience | Keyboard-driven workflows, SSH, low resources |
| **Memory** | ~100 MB | ~30 MB |
| **Exclusive features** | System tray integration | Request replay, SSH-compatible, tmux-friendly, non-interactive mode |
| **Shared features** | HTTP traffic logging, GitHub sync, auto import, auto-reconnection, TCP/UDP, expose (reverse tunneling) ||
| **Platform** | macOS, Linux, Windows | macOS, Linux, Windows |

Both interfaces read from the same SQLite database (`~/.kftray/kftray.db`), so you can mix and match based on the situation. Check the [Desktop Interface](/docs/interfaces/desktop) and [Terminal Interface](/docs/interfaces/terminal) pages for details.

## Usage at a Glance

You define port forwards as JSON configurations:

```json
{
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "namespace": "development",
  "local_port": 8080,
  "remote_port": 80,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "alias": "gateway"
}
```

Then enable them through either interface. kftray handles the connection lifecycle — including automatic reconnection when pods restart.
