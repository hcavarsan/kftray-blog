description: Capture and inspect HTTP traffic flowing through port forwards.
---

HTTP logging captures request and response data flowing through your port forwards for debugging API interactions.

## Enabling HTTP logging

<Tabs items={['Desktop', 'Terminal']}>
<Tab value="Desktop">

<Steps>
<Step>
Right-click the port forward in the desktop interface.
</Step>
<Step>
Select "Configure HTTP Logging".
</Step>
<Step>
Toggle "Enable HTTP Logging".
</Step>
<Step>
Click "Save".
</Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab value="Terminal">

Press `l` to toggle HTTP logging on the selected configuration, or set `"http_logs_enabled": true` in your JSON config.

Press `L` to configure log retention (1–365 days) and maximum log size (1–1000 MB).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Logging starts immediately for new connections. Existing connections continue without logging until they reconnect.

## Log file location

Logs are written to `~/.kftray/http_logs/` with one file per port forward:

<Files>
<Folder name="~/.kftray/http_logs" defaultOpen>
<File name="api-gateway-8080.log" />
<File name="auth-service-8001.log" />
<File name="user-service-8002.log" />
</Folder>
</Files>

File names follow the pattern `{alias-or-service}-{local-port}.log`.

## Log format

```

```

Each log entry includes:

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Timestamp | Millisecond precision |
| Trace ID | For correlating requests |
| HTTP method, path, status code | Request identification |
| Request duration | Timing information |
| Full request headers and body | Complete request capture |
| Full response headers and body | Complete response capture |

## Log management

### Viewing logs in kftui

Press `V` to open the log viewer for the selected configuration. From the detail view, press `r` to replay any captured HTTP request — useful for re-testing endpoints without leaving the terminal. Press `o` to open logs in your default external editor.

### Cleanup

Delete old logs manually:

```bash
rm ~/.kftray/http_logs/*.log
```

<Callout type="error" title="Sensitive data in logs">
HTTP logs capture full request and response bodies, including authentication tokens, API keys, and personal data. Delete logs when debugging is complete.
</Callout>
