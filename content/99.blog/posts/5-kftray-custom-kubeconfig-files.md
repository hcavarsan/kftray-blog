# Introducing KFTray v0.10.0 ðŸš€

We're pleased to share the release of KFTray v0.10.0. With this update, we've focused on making it easier for users to manage port-forward configurations across various kubeconfig files. We've also dedicated efforts to improve error handling for a more intuitive user experience.


If you don't know about KFTray, we have an article that provides a good overview of the app:

# What's New in Kftray v0.10.0?

## New Feature
- **Custom Kubeconfig Path**: This update allows users to set a custom path for their kubeconfig files. It's a handy feature for those working with multiple files and clusters, facilitating easier transitions between them.

## Enhancements
- **Better Error Handling**: We've worked on providing clearer feedback during the start or stop of port forwarding processes, aiming for a smoother interaction.
- **Code Quality Enhancements**: Through new linting and formatting rules, as well as thoughtful refactoring of our backend code, we've made strides in improving our code's quality and organization.
- **Updated Rust Version**: Keeping up with the latest developments, we've upgraded to Rust 1.78, ensuring our application benefits from the latest language improvements.

We hope you find these updates helpful in your Kubernetes endeavors.
