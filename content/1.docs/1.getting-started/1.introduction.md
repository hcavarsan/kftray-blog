# Introduction to KFtray

KFtray is a collection of applications designed to simplify Kubernetes port forwarding management. The suite includes two main interfaces:

- **KFtray GUI**: A system tray application with a graphical user interface
- **KFtui**: A terminal-based user interface

## Why kftray?

When working with Kubernetes, developers often face several challenges with the native `kubectl port-forward` command:

::list{type="info"}
- Manual reconnection required when connections drop
- Limited to TCP protocol only
- Single pod forwarding at a time
- Difficult configuration management
::

kftray addresses these limitations by providing:

::list{type="success"}
- Automatic reconnection for resilient connections
- Support for both TCP and UDP protocols
- Multiple simultaneous port forwards
- Centralized configuration management
- GitHub synchronization for team collaboration
- HTTP traffic logging for debugging
::

## Core Features
