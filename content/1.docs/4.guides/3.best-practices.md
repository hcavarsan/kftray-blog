# best practices

effective `kftray` usage develops through understanding how port forwarding fits into development workflows, team collaboration patterns, and operational requirements. these practices emerge from real-world usage across different team sizes and project complexities.

## when best practices matter

best practices become important when someone moves beyond basic usage to team collaboration, complex microservices environments, or production debugging scenarios. individual developers using simple configurations often don't need formal practices.

teams benefit most from establishing patterns early, especially around naming conventions, port assignments, and interface coordination. these practices prevent conflicts and confusion as teams grow.

## configuration organization and naming strategies

### meaningful naming patterns

configuration aliases should communicate purpose and environment clearly. instead of generic names like "service1" or "app", use descriptive patterns that help team members understand what each forward provides.

effective patterns include environment prefixes (`dev-gateway`, `staging-api`), service purpose (`user-auth`, `payment-processor`), or team ownership (`frontend-web`, `backend-orders`). consistency matters more than the specific pattern chosen.

example of clear naming:

```json
{
  "alias": "dev-user-api",
  "service": "user-service", 
  "namespace": "development",
  "local_port": 8081
}
```

### port assignment strategies

teams often establish port ranges to avoid conflicts and make configurations predictable. common patterns include grouping by service type (8080-8089 for APIs, 5432-5439 for databases) or by team ownership (8100-8199 for frontend team, 8200-8299 for backend team).

port conflicts cause frustration and slow development, so coordination becomes valuable as teams grow. document port assignments in team wikis or configuration repositories to help developers choose appropriate ports.

## interface coordination and process management

### understanding the shared state model

both interfaces show the same configuration database, but process management remains separate. when someone starts a forward in the desktop interface, both interfaces show it as "running," but only the desktop interface can stop it.

teams should establish clear patterns about which interface manages which forwards. common approaches include having each developer use one primary interface, or designating specific forwards to specific interfaces based on usage patterns.

document these decisions to prevent confusion when someone can't stop a forward or wonders why status shows differently between interfaces.

### development environment setup patterns

many teams develop standard configurations that all team members import to establish consistent development environments. this might include databases, shared services, and common APIs that everyone needs.

standardization reduces onboarding time and eliminates the "works on my machine" problems that arise from different port assignments or missing service access.

## team collaboration and configuration sharing

### repository-based sharing strategies

teams using github sync benefit from organized repository structures that separate environments and service types:

```
team-kftray-configs/
├── environments/
│   ├── development.json
│   ├── staging.json
│   └── production.json
├── services/
│   ├── frontend-services.json
│   ├── backend-services.json
│   └── infrastructure.json
└── README.md
```

this organization allows selective sharing where developers import only relevant configurations rather than everything the team uses.

### configuration review and change management

treating configuration changes like code changes improves team coordination. use pull requests for configuration updates, especially when changes affect shared services or established port assignments.

review processes help catch conflicts early and ensure changes align with team conventions. document reasoning for port assignments or configuration choices to help future team members understand decisions.

## security and access control considerations

### principle of least exposure

port forwarding potentially exposes cluster services to local networks, so consider what actually needs forwarding versus what's available for convenience. forward only services needed for current development work rather than maintaining permanent access to everything.

local port binding to `127.0.0.1` restricts access to the local machine, while binding to `0.0.0.0` allows network access. teams should establish policies about network-accessible forwards based on security requirements.

### credential and token management

github sync requires personal access tokens with repository permissions. teams should establish token rotation policies and ensure developers use tokens with minimal necessary scope.

avoid sharing tokens between team members -- each developer should generate their own with appropriate permissions. document token management procedures as part of team security practices.

### kubernetes access patterns

port forwarding inherits kubernetes RBAC permissions, so the same access controls that govern `kubectl` usage apply to `kftray`. teams should ensure port forwarding policies align with broader kubernetes access governance.

namespace isolation becomes important when forwarding exposes services across namespace boundaries. consider whether development port forwarding should access production namespaces, and implement appropriate controls.

## performance and resource management

### system resource considerations

the desktop interface uses more memory and CPU than the terminal interface, which matters in resource-constrained environments. teams working on older hardware or in container environments may benefit from standardizing on the terminal interface.

multiple simultaneous forwards consume network bandwidth and system resources proportional to traffic volume. monitor resource usage during heavy development periods and adjust configurations if performance becomes problematic.

### log management and cleanup

http logging (desktop interface only) generates significant disk usage for high-traffic services. establish log rotation policies and cleanup procedures to prevent disk space issues.

application logs in `~/.kftray/app.log` also accumulate over time. include log cleanup in regular maintenance procedures, or configure automatic rotation if the system supports it.

## monitoring and health verification

### connection health practices

port forwards can fail silently when kubernetes pods restart or network connectivity changes. develop habits around verifying forward status, especially before important development sessions or demos.

automated health checks work well for critical forwards. simple scripts that test connectivity to forwarded ports can detect failures early and trigger reconnection.

### traffic monitoring and debugging

http logging provides valuable debugging information but impacts performance and disk usage. use logging selectively for specific debugging sessions rather than continuous monitoring.

when debugging complex interactions, correlate http logs with application logs and kubernetes events to understand the complete request flow.

## development workflow integration

### daily development patterns

many developers establish routine startup procedures that activate necessary forwards for current work. this might involve enabling specific configurations, checking forward status, and verifying connectivity to critical services.

shutdown procedures become equally important -- stopping unnecessary forwards reduces resource usage and eliminates potential conflicts for future sessions.

### testing and validation workflows

include port forward verification in testing procedures, especially for integration tests that depend on cluster services. automated tests should verify that expected forwards are active and responding correctly.

configuration validation helps catch problems early. test new configurations against development environments before sharing with teams or deploying to staging/production contexts.

## documentation and knowledge sharing

### configuration documentation patterns

document not just what configurations exist, but why specific choices were made. port assignments, service dependencies, and environment-specific variations help team members understand and maintain configurations.

include troubleshooting information specific to the team's environment. common failure modes, diagnostic procedures, and recovery steps reduce time spent on recurring issues.

### onboarding and training procedures

new team members need clear guidance about configuration setup, interface choice, and team conventions. document the standard development environment setup process to reduce onboarding friction.

include information about team-specific practices like port ranges, naming conventions, and preferred interfaces. this helps new developers integrate quickly without conflicting with established patterns.

## operational considerations for production access

### production debugging policies

port forwarding to production environments requires careful consideration of security, audit trails, and access controls. establish clear policies about when production forwarding is appropriate and what approval processes apply.

temporary forwarding for debugging should include time limits and documentation requirements. consider whether production access logs need retention for compliance or security audit purposes.

### incident response procedures

during production incidents, port forwarding can provide crucial debugging access. include forwarding procedures in incident response playbooks, with pre-configured access for emergency scenarios.

coordinate forwarding during incidents to avoid conflicts and ensure appropriate access without overwhelming production services with debugging traffic.

## evolving practices with team maturity

teams often start with simple configuration sharing and evolve toward more sophisticated practices as they grow. begin with basic naming conventions and port coordination, then add repository-based sharing and automated procedures as needed.

avoid over-engineering practices for small teams, but establish foundations that scale well. simple documentation and basic coordination prevent many common problems without excessive overhead.

regular review of team practices helps identify what works well and what needs adjustment. port forwarding patterns should evolve with team size, project complexity, and operational requirements.
