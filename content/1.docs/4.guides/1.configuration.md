# configuring kftray

configuration in `kftray` centers around JSON objects that describe port-forwarding setups. both the desktop and terminal interfaces work with the same configuration database, so changes made in one appear immediately in the other.

## when configuration matters

most developers start with simple port forwards and gradually need more sophisticated configuration as their kubernetes environment grows. someone working with a single microservice might only need basic settings, while teams managing dozens of services need organized configuration strategies.

configuration becomes important when dealing with multiple kubernetes contexts, custom kubeconfig files, team sharing requirements, or complex networking setups that require specific local addresses or proxy settings.

## configuration data model

based on the source code analysis, `kftray` configurations include these fields:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "namespace": "production",
  "local_port": 8080,
  "remote_port": 8080,
  "context": "prod-cluster",
  "workload_type": "service",
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "remote_address": null,
  "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
  "auto_loopback_address": false,
  "alias": "gateway",
  "domain_enabled": false,
  "kubeconfig": "/Users/dev/.kube/prod-config",
  "target": null
}
```

## essential fields

the core fields that every configuration needs:

**service**: name of the kubernetes service or pod to forward to. this must match exactly what appears in `kubectl get services` or `kubectl get pods`.

**namespace**: kubernetes namespace containing the target service. defaults to "default" if not specified.

**local_port** and **remote_port**: the ports for forwarding. local_port binds on the developer's machine, remote_port connects to the kubernetes service.

**context**: kubernetes context name from kubeconfig. this determines which cluster the forward targets.

**protocol**: either "tcp" or "udp". tcp works directly, udp requires the `kftray-server` proxy deployment.

## optional configuration fields

**workload_type**: "service" or "pod". services work better for stable connections, pods for debugging specific instances.

**alias**: human-readable name for the configuration. appears in the interface instead of service names.

**kubeconfig**: path to a specific kubeconfig file. useful when working with multiple clusters that use different authentication.

**local_address**: bind address for the local port. defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only). set to 0.0.0.0 for network-wide access.

**remote_address**: target address within the cluster. usually left empty to use the service's default address.

**auto_loopback_address**: automatically configure local hostfile entries. helpful for services that expect specific domain names.

**domain_enabled**: enable local domain resolution for the service. works with auto_loopback_address for complex networking setups.

**target**: specific target within the service. used for advanced routing scenarios.

## storage and persistence

both interfaces store configuration in `~/.kftray/kftray.db` using SQLite. this database includes configuration definitions, state tracking, and run history.

log files go to `~/.kftray/app.log` for general application logs and `~/.kftray/http_logs/` for http traffic captures (when enabled).

configuration changes persist across application restarts and remain consistent between the desktop and terminal interfaces.

## workflow-based configuration patterns

### single-service development

someone working on one microservice typically needs just the service itself and its database:

```json
[
  {
    "service": "user-api",
    "namespace": "development",
    "local_port": 8080,
    "remote_port": 8080,
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "alias": "api"
  },
  {
    "service": "postgres",
    "namespace": "development", 
    "local_port": 5432,
    "remote_port": 5432,
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "alias": "db"
  }
]
```

### microservices development

teams working with multiple services need organized port assignments to avoid conflicts:

```json
[
  {
    "service": "gateway",
    "local_port": 8080,
    "alias": "gw"
  },
  {
    "service": "user-service",
    "local_port": 8081,
    "alias": "users"
  },
  {
    "service": "payment-service", 
    "local_port": 8082,
    "alias": "payments"
  },
  {
    "service": "notification-service",
    "local_port": 8083,
    "alias": "notifications"
  }
]
```

### multi-environment access

developers often need access to different environments (staging, production) with environment-specific configurations:

```json
[
  {
    "service": "api",
    "namespace": "staging",
    "context": "staging-cluster",
    "local_port": 8080,
    "kubeconfig": "/Users/dev/.kube/staging-config",
    "alias": "staging-api"
  },
  {
    "service": "api",
    "namespace": "production", 
    "context": "prod-cluster",
    "local_port": 8090,
    "kubeconfig": "/Users/dev/.kube/prod-config",
    "alias": "prod-api"
  }
]
```

## team configuration sharing

### file-based sharing

export configurations to JSON files for team sharing:

```bash
# desktop interface: export from the menu
# terminal interface: copy the configuration from ~/.kftray/
```

team members import the shared JSON file, then adjust local ports if needed to avoid conflicts.

### github-based sharing

the desktop interface supports github repository sync for automatic configuration distribution. this works best for teams that want centralized configuration management.

set up a repository with configuration files, configure github sync in `kftray`, and team members automatically receive configuration updates.

## advanced networking configuration

### custom bind addresses

by default, port forwards bind to localhost only (127.0.0.1). for network-wide access, set local_address to 0.0.0.0:

```json
{
  "service": "web-app",
  "local_port": 3000,
  "local_address": "0.0.0.0",
  "alias": "web"
}
```

this allows other machines on the network to access the forwarded service.

### udp service forwarding

udp services require the `kftray-server` proxy component deployed in the kubernetes cluster:

```json
{
  "service": "dns-service",
  "protocol": "udp",
  "local_port": 53,
  "remote_port": 53,
  "alias": "dns"
}
```

the proxy handles udp traffic that kubernetes can't forward directly.

### domain name resolution

enable local domain resolution for services that expect specific hostnames:

```json
{
  "service": "web-app",
  "domain_enabled": true,
  "auto_loopback_address": true,
  "alias": "app"
}
```

this configures local DNS entries so applications can access services by name instead of localhost:port.

## configuration validation and troubleshooting

### common configuration problems

**port conflicts**: multiple configurations using the same local_port cause binding errors. each active configuration needs a unique local port.

**context mismatches**: context names must match exactly what appears in kubeconfig. use `kubectl config get-contexts` to verify available contexts.

**namespace issues**: services must exist in the specified namespace. use `kubectl get services -n <namespace>` to verify service names.

**protocol mismatches**: udp forwarding requires the proxy server deployment. tcp forwards work directly with the kubernetes API.

### configuration testing

test configurations before saving by checking that the target service exists and responds:

```bash
kubectl get service <service-name> -n <namespace> --context <context>
```

for services that aren't responding, check that pods are running and service selectors match pod labels.

## configuration file management

### backup strategies

regular configuration exports provide backup and version control:

```bash
# desktop: use export menu option
# terminal: copy ~/.kftray/kftray.db
```

store configuration files in version control alongside application code for team consistency.

### migration between systems

when moving to a new development machine, copy the entire `~/.kftray/` directory to preserve configurations, state, and logs.

alternatively, export configurations to JSON and import on the new system for a clean setup.

## performance and resource considerations

### configuration scale limits

`kftray` handles dozens of simultaneous port forwards efficiently. performance depends more on network bandwidth and kubernetes cluster capacity than configuration count.

very large configuration sets (100+) may benefit from organization strategies like environment-specific grouping or role-based configuration subsets.

### memory and cpu usage

each active port forward consumes minimal resources. the configuration database and interface overhead typically use under 100MB RAM regardless of configuration count.

network traffic and http logging (when enabled) have the most impact on resource usage.

## realistic configuration workflow

here's how configuration typically evolves in practice:

someone starts with basic service+database forwarding for local development. as the project grows, they add more microservices with organized port ranges. when the team expands, configuration sharing becomes important for consistency.

eventually, multiple environments require context-specific configurations, and features like github sync or advanced networking become useful for workflow efficiency.

the key is starting simple and adding complexity only when the basic approach becomes limiting.
