# command line reference

both `kftray` interfaces operate primarily through their respective user interfaces, but understanding command-line behavior helps with automation, troubleshooting, and integration scenarios.

## when command-line knowledge matters

command-line understanding becomes important when someone needs to integrate port forwarding into scripts, debug startup issues, or automate configuration management. developers working in CI/CD environments or server deployments particularly benefit from understanding these patterns.

the desktop interface (`kftray`) operates primarily through the graphical interface but accepts some command-line parameters. the terminal interface (`kftui`) provides keyboard-driven interaction rather than traditional command-line options.

## desktop interface command-line behavior

### startup and initialization

the desktop application launches through standard platform mechanisms: application bundle on macos, executable on windows, or AppImage on linux. double-clicking the application icon or using platform-specific launchers provides the typical startup method.

command-line execution works for automation and debugging scenarios:

```bash
# macOS
/Applications/KFtray.app/Contents/MacOS/KFtray

# Linux 
./KFtray.AppImage

# Windows
KFtray.exe
```

### configuration directory and data location

the application stores configuration and state in platform-appropriate locations. understanding these paths helps with backup procedures and troubleshooting:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/kftray/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/kftray/` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kftray/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\kftray\`

the SQLite database (`kftray.db`) contains all configuration and state information. log files appear in `app.log` within the same directory.

### debugging and verbose output

enabling debug output helps diagnose startup and connection issues. the application logs detailed information to the `app.log` file automatically, but console output provides immediate feedback during troubleshooting:

```bash
# Enable debug logging (varies by platform)
RUST_LOG=debug ./KFtray.AppImage

# On macOS with bundle
RUST_LOG=debug /Applications/KFtray.app/Contents/MacOS/KFtray
```

this approach shows initialization steps, kubernetes connectivity attempts, and port forwarding operations in real-time.

## terminal interface interaction patterns

### navigation and control structure

`kftui` operates entirely through keyboard commands within the terminal interface. the application doesn't accept traditional command-line arguments but responds to terminal environment variables and settings.

launching the terminal interface requires appropriate terminal dimensions and capabilities:

```bash
# Basic launch
kftui

# With specific terminal settings
TERM=xterm-256color kftui

# In screen or tmux session
screen -S kftray kftui
tmux new-session -s kftray kftui
```

terminal size requirements affect interface usability. minimum 80x24 character dimensions provide basic functionality, while larger terminals improve readability and information display.

### keyboard command reference

the interface operates through single-key commands that perform immediate actions:

**navigation commands:**
- arrow keys navigate through configuration lists
- tab switches between interface sections
- enter confirms selections and actions

**configuration management:**
- `i` opens import dialog for JSON configuration files
- `e` exports current configurations to JSON files
- `d` deletes selected configurations with confirmation

**port forwarding operations:**
- `f` toggles port forwarding for selected configurations
- space bar selects individual configurations for batch operations
- ctrl+a selects all configurations simultaneously

**utility commands:**
- `h` opens contextual help for current interface section
- `q` quits the application cleanly
- `r` refreshes kubernetes context and service information

### file import and export workflow

configuration management through file operations provides automation and sharing capabilities. the import process accepts JSON files with configuration arrays:

```bash
# Configuration file format
[
  {
    "service": "api-gateway",
    "namespace": "development", 
    "local_port": 8080,
    "remote_port": 80,
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "alias": "dev-api"
  }
]
```

export operations create files in the same format, suitable for version control, backup, or sharing across team members.

## environment configuration and integration

### kubernetes context management

both interfaces inherit kubernetes configuration from the environment. standard `kubectl` configuration applies directly to `kftray` operations:

```bash
# Context selection affects kftray behavior
kubectl config use-context development-cluster

# Custom kubeconfig location
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/custom-config

# Multiple configuration files
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/dev-config
```

namespace access depends on kubernetes RBAC permissions. the same permissions that allow `kubectl port-forward` operations enable `kftray` port forwarding.

### logging and output control

log level and output destination configuration helps with debugging and monitoring:

```bash
# Environment variable control
export RUST_LOG=info          # Basic information
export RUST_LOG=debug         # Detailed debugging
export RUST_LOG=warn          # Warnings and errors only

# Component-specific logging
export RUST_LOG=kftray=debug,kube=info
```

the terminal interface respects terminal capabilities and adjusts display accordingly. colorization, character encoding, and terminal type detection happen automatically based on environment variables.

## automation and scripting integration

### desktop interface automation

the desktop interface provides limited automation capabilities through configuration file management and system integration:

```bash
# Automated configuration deployment
cp team-configs.json ~/.local/share/kftray/
# Application detects and imports automatically

# Backup automation
tar -czf kftray-backup.tar.gz ~/.local/share/kftray/
```

github sync functionality provides team-level automation for configuration distribution and updates.

### terminal interface scripting

the terminal interface works well in scripted environments with proper session management:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example automation script

# Start persistent session
screen -dmS kftray-session kftui

# Import configurations (requires manual interaction)
# screen -S kftray-session -p 0 -X stuff 'i^M'

# Monitor session
screen -ls | grep kftray
```

fully automated operation requires pre-positioned configuration files and careful session management due to the interactive nature of the interface.

## integration with development workflows

### ci/cd pipeline integration

continuous integration scenarios often need programmatic port forwarding for testing:

```bash
# Example CI workflow component
if command -v kftui >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Launch in background session
    screen -dmS testing-forwards kftui
    
    # Wait for initialization
    sleep 5
    
    # Run tests against forwarded services
    npm run test:integration
    
    # Clean up
    screen -S testing-forwards -X quit
fi
```

this approach provides isolated port forwarding for testing scenarios without interfering with development environments.

### container and orchestration usage

containerized development environments benefit from port forwarding automation:

```dockerfile
# Example development container setup
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl screen
RUN curl -L -o kftui https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray/releases/latest/download/kftui_amd64
RUN chmod +x kftui && mv kftui /usr/local/bin/

# Container startup can launch kftui in background
CMD ["screen", "-dmS", "kftray", "kftui"]
```

kubernetes environments can deploy the terminal interface for debugging and development access scenarios.

## troubleshooting command-line issues

### common startup problems

permission and dependency issues often prevent proper application startup:

```bash
# Check execution permissions
ls -la /usr/local/bin/kftui
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kftui

# Verify dependencies (Linux)
ldd /usr/local/bin/kftui

# Check system requirements
echo $TERM
tput colors
```

library dependency problems typically indicate missing system packages or incompatible linux distributions.

### configuration and state problems

command-line diagnostic procedures help identify configuration issues:

```bash
# Check configuration directory
ls -la ~/.local/share/kftray/

# Verify database accessibility
file ~/.local/share/kftray/kftray.db

# Review recent logs
tail -f ~/.local/share/kftray/app.log
```

database corruption or permission problems often require configuration directory cleanup and reinitialization.

### kubernetes connectivity debugging

verifying kubernetes access independently helps isolate connection problems:

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
kubectl cluster-info

# Verify context and permissions
kubectl config current-context
kubectl auth can-i create pods

# Test port forwarding manually
kubectl port-forward svc/test-service 8080:80
```

these commands verify that kubernetes access works correctly outside of `kftray`, helping distinguish between kubernetes and application issues.
