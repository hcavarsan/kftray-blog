# using kftui terminal interface

the terminal interface provides keyboard-driven port forward management with minimal resource usage. understanding the navigation patterns and workflow helps developers manage configurations efficiently through keyboard commands.

## keyboard navigation and interface layout

the interface operates entirely through keyboard commands for efficiency and accessibility. arrow keys navigate between configurations, tab switches between interface sections, and space selects items for batch operations.

key workflow commands include `f` for toggling port forwards, `i` for importing configurations, `e` for exporting, and `q` to quit. the `h` key opens contextual help that displays available commands for the current interface section.

the interface displays configurations in a table format showing alias, port mapping, namespace, and current status. running forwards show green status indicators, while stopped forwards appear with red indicators.

## configuration file management

importing configurations uses the `i` key to open a file browser interface. navigate to the JSON configuration file using arrow keys and select with enter. the system validates configuration format and provides feedback about successful imports or errors.

typical configuration files contain service definitions with namespace, port mappings, protocol specifications, and meaningful aliases. teams often maintain shared configuration files that multiple developers import for consistent environments.

exporting configurations uses the `e` key to save current configurations to JSON files. choose the save location through the file browser, enter a filename, and confirm with enter. exported files work with both terminal and desktop interfaces for cross-platform sharing.

## port forward workflow management

starting forwards begins with selecting target configurations using the space bar for individual selections or ctrl+a for all configurations. press `f` to toggle forwarding for selected items. the interface provides immediate feedback about connection attempts and status changes.

stopping forwards uses the same selection and toggle pattern. navigate to running configurations, select them with space, and press `f` to stop forwarding. status updates appear immediately when forwards stop successfully.

bulk operations help manage multiple forwards efficiently. select multiple configurations and toggle them simultaneously, or use ctrl+a to affect all configurations at once. the `d` key deletes selected configurations after confirmation prompts.

## advanced workflow capabilities

auto import discovers services in the current kubernetes context and suggests configuration entries. access this feature through the tab menu system, select "Auto Import", choose the target context, and review suggested configurations before importing.

the auto import feature scans namespaces for services with port configurations and creates reasonable defaults for local port assignments. review suggestions carefully to avoid port conflicts with existing forwards or local services.

configuration organization benefits from meaningful aliases that communicate service purpose and environment context. regular exports create backup copies and enable sharing configurations across team members or different systems.

## terminal environment and workflow optimization

terminal setup affects interface usability significantly. maintain at least 80x24 terminal dimensions for proper layout, though larger sizes improve readability. enable 256-color support and UTF-8 character encoding for correct display rendering.

modern terminal emulators provide better compatibility and performance than basic terminal applications. update terminal software regularly to avoid display issues or input handling problems.

efficient navigation develops through keyboard shortcut familiarity and bulk operation usage. organize configurations logically to reduce navigation time and use consistent naming patterns for quick identification.

remote usage scenarios benefit from persistent terminal sessions using screen or tmux. these tools maintain interface state across network disconnections and allow resuming work from different locations.

## workflow problem resolution

display problems usually involve terminal compatibility issues including insufficient size, missing color support, or character encoding problems. verify terminal capabilities and update terminal software when display appears corrupted or incomplete.

connection issues follow the same patterns as the desktop interface but may be harder to diagnose without visual status indicators. verify kubernetes cluster access independently, check service existence and status, and confirm RBAC permissions for port forwarding operations.

performance considerations become more important in resource-constrained environments where the terminal interface provides advantages over the desktop version. limit concurrent forwards to reduce memory and network usage, and monitor system resources during heavy usage periods.

## efficiency patterns and advanced techniques

quick selection patterns reduce interaction time for common operations. master ctrl+a for selecting all configurations when starting or stopping multiple forwards simultaneously. use space for individual selections when working with specific service subsets.

state management becomes critical for teams sharing configurations or working across multiple environments. establish regular export schedules to backup configuration changes and document modifications for team coordination.

remote work scenarios require consideration of network stability and session persistence. maintain long-running terminal sessions through screen or tmux, especially when managing forwards that should remain active across SSH disconnections.

these patterns help developers integrate the terminal interface effectively into existing workflow patterns while taking advantage of its efficiency and minimal resource requirements.
